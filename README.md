# cc_2_bbl434
Bioinformatics Coding Challenge

OVERVIEW:
This project implements sequence alignment algorithms using Dynamic Programming 
(Manhattan Tourist/Chandigarh Gedi approach).

As told by you in the class i've kept in mind the 2 things
- The code takes input for user for all 4, match, mismatch, gap opening and gap extension
- DP algorithm solves for every 2 points in between rather than just the start and end 2 points

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- src/: Contains the Python source code.

HOW TO RUN:
You can run the individual scripts from the terminal:

1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
   python src/lcs.py

2. Global Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch):
   python src/global_alignment.py

3. Local Alignment (Smith-Waterman): #Main script
   python src/local_alignment.p
